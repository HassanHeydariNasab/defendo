How to win
==========

Introduction
-------------
Here is the introduction in normal words, more understandable than the official one.

There are 3 kinds of shooting weapons:
* laser - large range, range scales with upgrades
* plasma - rapid shooting rate, big damage
* shockwave - slows down the mobs and make them some damage

... and one kind of non-shooting:
* mines - damage nearby mobs

Every weapon damage scales with upgrades.

Every shot from any shooting weapon costs one credit.

We call the big circle in the bottom a base.

Every weapon instance costs fixed amount of credits. Weapons can be merged into an upgraded version of a weapon by putting them into a base. You must put instances exactly of 1 kind into a base, otherwise it won't work, even if you remove all the instances of another kind. In this kind move everything out of base and start merging from scratch. When a thing is on the base you can hit a button to buy that kind of weapon to upgrade the one placed over base by 1.

There are 4 kinds of mobs:
* the small and fast ones
* the big and slow ones
* the slow and invincible to ```plasma``` and ```mines```, but vulnerable to ```shockwave``` and ```laser```.

The current game design is somehow disbalanced. I have found a winning strategy.

What makes this strategy work is:
* every shot costs ```1``` credit, disrespect to damage. So larger the upgrade level of a weapon, cheaper its damage to mobs, cheaper the damage to mobs - cheaper the kill, cheaper the kill - more profit, more profit - more upgrades can be bought. It is a positive feedback loop.
* one high-level weapon is preferred over multiple equivalent and even more powerful. It is because ```n``` weapons will shoot simultaneously consuming ```n*1``` credits, but will deal presumably the same damage. So more weapons you have - more the costs. You need to keep count of weapons at minimum to reduce the costs. If you have multiple weapons their ranges mustn't overlap to reduce costs.
So ...

The strategy
------------

1. Start the game
2. Buy a plasma and place it over the top slot.
3. Buy a one more plasma and place it over the base.
4. Look at money and start buying plasmas, keeping enough money to pay for count of shots enough to kill the nearest mob.
5. When the enemies are out of range, move the weapon over the base to merge the upgrades into it. Do it as frequently as you can. Remember, more the upgrades the weapon have - more money you will get for upgrades.

6. Buy some mines and put them over all the empty slots. They will be upgraded for free with time.
7. Periodically merge all the mines into powerfull ones and place them into a place where they cannot be reached by low-level mobs. It's your "insurance" for the case your system is unable to destroy a powerful mob. In fact it is useful only in beginning when you have not accumulated high-level weapons.

8. Then buy 2 shockwaves and a laser. Empty top slots occupied with mines and put them there.
9. Upgrade the weapons.
10. When your system can easily defeat any enemy you can buy a network upgrade if you want to the enemies to get into the range faster. In fact it is more profitable to buy weapons upgrade, if you are wiling to spend your time.
